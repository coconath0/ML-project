# Project Progress Report Title: 

** Every team member **NEEDS** to submit the files on CANVAS.**
## Team

- Name (NetID): Expanded roles and current contributions.

* Aleena Tomy (zdh39):
* JD (John) Escobedo (dxh19):
## Project Abstract
- [ ] Refined abstract, incorporating instructor comments.

## Problem Statement
- [ ] Expanded explanation, addressing all feedback and what has been learned about dataset and the task since project proposal. 

## Dataset
- [ ] Data description and visualization (figures/tables as relevant).
- [ ] Observations of distributions, correlations, outlier detection, and data cleaning.
- [ ] Insights gained from EDA that inform next steps.

## Methodology

### Baseline method implementation
- [ ] Description of baseline model(s) attempted.
- [ ] Results: quantitative metrics and  qualitative observations.
- [ ] Discussion of results: What do baseline results reveal about the problem/data?
- [ ] Visual or tabular summaries as appropriate.

### Improvements and other methods implementation
- [ ] Feature engineering, feature selection, high dimensionality mitigation. 
- [ ] Potentially better fit model proposed here. Explain why is it a better fit. 
- [ ] Show implementation, hypertuning.  
- [ ] Propose what you will do in the remaining week. 

## Teaming Strategy
- [ ] Individual team member contributions.

| Name            | Contribution                          | Section(s) Authored / Tasks Completed |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| [ ] Team Member | What where how                        |

(Add additional rows as needed for each member.)


## Mitigation Plan

- [ ] Key milestones or tasks to be completed by project end.
- [ ] Who is responsible for each task?
- [ ] Timeline/checkpoints to ensure on-time submission.
- [ ] What if you fail?
